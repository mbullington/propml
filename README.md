PropML
-------------

*Version 0.1.0 - July 4th, 2015*

PropML is a markup language designed specifically for manual document creation.

**PropML is not, and will never be, a suitable format for data storage or transport.**

This document outlines the language syntax of PropML.

PropML documents can be freestanding (in the form of a file with a .spec file
extension), or created as a DSL from a language with string templating
capabilities. This document outlines guidelines for both use cases.

This document will also provide guidelines for the APIs exposed to applications
by PropML implementations.

In the future, PropML will have a reference implementation for ES6, with ES5
support using Babel.

As PropML is a new and evolving language, concepts and rules found in later
versions may not be present in the current version of this specification, or may
be different from this version of the specification.
